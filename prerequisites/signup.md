# Signing Up for an IBM Cloud Account

You must have a valid IBM Cloud Account to complete exercises in the workshops.

New IBM Cloud accounts default to a [new "lite" account version](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/free/); other [IBM Cloud pricing options](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/pricing) are available if you wish to upgrade at a later time.

_This account provides free access to a subset of IBM Cloud resources, including IBM Cloud Functions. Lite accounts do not need a credit-card to sign up or expire after a set time period, i.e. 30 days._

Developers using "_Lite accounts_" are restricted to development within a single region. Accounts are automatically assigned to either `UK South` or `US South` regions depending on user profile location.

_**Note** IBM Cloud Functions is_ [_available in other regions_](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cloudfunctions_regions) _as well if you upgrade from a Lite account._
