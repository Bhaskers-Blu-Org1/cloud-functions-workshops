# Installing Cloud Functions Plugin

This section will take you step-by-step through the [setup of the IBM Cloud Functions CLI plugin](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/learn/cli).

## Install IBM Cloud Functions CLI plugin

Use this command to install the Cloud Functions plugin for the IBM Cloud CLI.

```text
$ ibmcloud plugin install cloud-functions
```

```text

Plug-in 'cloud-functions 1.0.xx' was successfully installed into /Users/Joesephine/.bluemix/plugins/cloud-functions. Use 'ibmcloud plugin show cloud-functions' to show its details.
```

## Test IBM Cloud Functions From The CLI

Run the following command to invoke a test function from the command-line.

```text
$ ibmcloud fn action invoke whisk.system/utils/echo -p message hello --result
```

```text
{
    "message": "hello"
}
```

_If this command executes successfully, you have verified that the IBM Cloud CLI and Cloud Functions plugin have been installed and configured correctly. If this does not work, please contact the workshop organiser to provide assistance!_

## Using aliases for the Cloud Functions plugin

The IBM Cloud Functions plugin is referenced as a sub-command under the IBM Cloud CLI by its name `cloud-functions`, but can also be referenced by the shorter aliases `functions`, `fn` and `wsk`.

_**Note**: This `cloud-functions` CLI plugin provides the_ [_Apache OpenWhisk CLI_](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/cli.md) _as a sub-command under the IBM Cloud CLI. Platform credentials are provided automatically by the IBM Cloud CLI. THis is why one of the aliases is named `wsk`._
