## Setting Up a Development Environment

This exercise will set up your local development environment to use IBM Cloud Functions. These steps are a prerequisite before you can start building serverless applications.

_Once you have completed this exercise, you will haveâ€¦_

* **Registered an IBM Cloud account.**
* **Installed and configured IBM Cloud CLI tools.**
* **Tested a sample IBM Cloud Functions action from the command-line.**

Once this exercise is finished, we can start to develop serverless applications using IBM Cloud Functions!
