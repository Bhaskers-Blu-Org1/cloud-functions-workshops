# Sign Up for an IBM Cloud Account

You must have a valid IBM Cloud Account to complete exercises in the workshops.

New IBM Cloud accounts default to a [new "lite" account version](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/free/); other [IBM Cloud pricing options](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/pricing) are available if you wish to upgrade at a later time.

_This account provides free access to a subset of IBM Cloud resources, including IBM Cloud Functions. Lite accounts do not need a credit-card to sign up or expire after a set time period, i.e. 30 days._

Developers using "_Lite accounts_" are restricted to development within a single region. Accounts are automatically assigned to either `UK South` or `US South` regions depending on user profile location.

_**Note** IBM Cloud Functions is [available in other regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cloudfunctions_regions) as well if you upgrade from a Lite account._

## Verify Default Region

ðŸš¨ **Please follow this instructions** _
We know it looks boring but trust us! People often skim this part and then complain they can't login into the CLI. These instructions will save you all that inevitable confusion..._ðŸš¨

Follow these instructions to check which default region your lite account has been assigned.

1. Open the [Cloud Foundry Organizations](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/cloud-foundry) page
1. Click the organization `name` listed in the table.
*Note that your organization is usually the email address you signed up with*
