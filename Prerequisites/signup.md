# Sign Up for an IBM Cloud Account

You must have a valid IBM Cloud Account to complete exercises in the workshops.

New IBM Cloud accounts default to a [new "lite" account version](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/free/); other [IBM Cloud pricing options](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/pricing) are available if you wish to upgrade at a later time.

_This account provides free access to a subset of IBM Cloud resources, including IBM Cloud Functions. Lite accounts do not need a credit-card to sign up or expire after a set time period, i.e. 30 days._

Developers using "_Lite accounts_" are restricted to development within a single region. Accounts are automatically assigned to either `eu-gb` or `us-south` regions depending on user profile location.

## Create an Account

1. Open a browser window
1. Navigate to [https://cloud.ibm.com/registration](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration)

**When setting up the IBM Cloud CLI, choose the API endpoint for the default account region.**

Follow these instructions to check which default region your lite account has been assigned.

it should have a value of `UK South` or `US South`:

Remember this value for the next step (Installing the IBM Cloud CLI):

_**Note** IBM Cloud Functions is [available in other regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cloudfunctions_regions) as well if you upgrade from a Lite account._
