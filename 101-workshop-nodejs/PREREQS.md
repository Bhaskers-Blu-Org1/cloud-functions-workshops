# Install lab prerequisites

In order to put into practice the serverless concepts and patterns already discussed, we will use IBM Cloud and the [IBM Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions), service from this point on for all lab exercises.  This will require a free account on IBM Cloud to utilize the IBM Cloud Functions (ICF) service.

To perform course labs, you will need to follow these steps:

## Register for a free IBM Cloud Account and target a supported region

1. Register for a free IBM Cloud account using the linked instructions:
    - [https://cloud.ibm.com/registration](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration)

2. Target a region that supports IBM Cloud Functions using the following link:
    - [Target a supported regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cloudfunctions_regions) using the CLI.

## Install the IBM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI) and Cloud Functions plugin

1. Install the [IBM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) by following the steps outlined on the linked page.

2. Install the [Cloud Functions (CF)](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/learn/cli) plugin by following the steps outlined on the linked page.
