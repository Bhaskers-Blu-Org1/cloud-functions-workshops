# Install lab prerequisites

In order to put into practice the serverless concepts and patterns discussed in the first chapter, we will use IBM Cloud and the IBM Cloud Functions service from this point on for all lab exercises.  This will require a free account on IBM Cloud to utilize the IBM Cloud Functions (ICF) service.

To perform course labs, you will need to follow these steps:

## Register for a free IBM Cloud Account

1. Register for a free IBM Cloud account using the linked instructions:
    - [https://cloud.ibm.com/registration](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration)

2. Target a region that supports IBM Cloud Functions using the following link:
    - [Target a supported regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cloudfunctions_regions) using the CLI.

## Install the IBM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI) and Cloud Functions plugin

1. Install the [IBM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started).

2. Install the [Cloud Functions (CF)](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/learn/cli) plugin.
