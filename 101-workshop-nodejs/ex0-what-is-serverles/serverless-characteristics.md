# Characteristics of Serverless

## Taking the "Ops" out of "DevOps"

In today's agile-focused world, Developers are now (more than ever) expected to understand the operational considerations of deploying, hosting and maintaining their applications "on the Cloud"; hence the term "DevOps".

However, this often means less time actually coding the application and much more time worrying about the operational aspects.

## “→ NoOps” for the Developer

Providers of Serverless computing strive to **approach zero operational considerations**, often referred to as "NoOps", for the Developer.

### Provider “implements” Operations

with the following goals:

- **Maximizing Utilization**
    - Compute / Memory / Networking

- **Minimizing Compute Costs**
    - Pay-As-You-GO (PAYGO) cost model

- **Guarantees all the "Ops"**
    - Performance, Scaling, Multi-region,
    - High Availability (HA),
    - Security, Monitoring, Logging, etc.
