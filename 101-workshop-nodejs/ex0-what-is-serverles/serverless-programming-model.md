# Serverless Programming Model

## The Least Common Denominator (LCD) view

There is no open standard for Serverless, its programming model, its deployment model or as a consequence its APIs.  Different providers may use different, but similar, semantics to describe the component parts that play a role in taking an event and causing a Serverless function to execute.

Shown below is a basic view of how Serverless works using the most common semantics from the Serverless domain and applicable to IBM Cloud Functions.
