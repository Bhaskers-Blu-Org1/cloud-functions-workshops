# Characteristics of serverless

## Taking the Ops out of DevOps

In today's agile-focused world, developers are now, more than ever, expected to understand the operational considerations of deploying, hosting, and maintaining their applications on the cloud. This often means developers spend less time coding applications and much more time worrying about the operational aspects.

## NoOps for developers

To enable developers to focus on coding, providers of serverless computing strive to approach **zero** operational considerations. This can be achieved by offloading all the labor-intensive operational tasks to the serverless provider which includes:

- Maximizing compute, memory, and networking utilization

- Minimizing compute costs by using a _[Pay-As-You-GO (PAYGO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAYGO)_ cost model

- Guaranteeing all the Ops, including:
  - Scaling
  - Low latency
  - High Availability (HA)
  - Multi-region
  - Monitoring
  - Logging
  - Security

Savings on your serverless operational features may vary by provider and Service License Agreements (SLAs).

IBM Cloud Functions (ICF) and its SLA offers operational services at the highest level of quality and service for every price plan.

## Back to coding

Thanks to serverless, once the Ops is taken out of DevOps, developers can return their attention to writing amazing applications that focus on business logic. The result is not only increased agility delivering software based on actual customer needs, but also serves to maximize developer joy in doing their daily work.
