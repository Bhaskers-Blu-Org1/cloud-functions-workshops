# Characteristics of Serverless

## Taking the "Ops" out of "DevOps"

In today's agile-focused world, Developers are now (more than ever) expected to understand the operational considerations of deploying, hosting and maintaining their applications "on the Cloud"; hence the term "DevOps".

However, this often means less time actually coding the application and much more time worrying about the operational aspects.

## “→ NoOps” for the Developer

Providers of Serverless computing strive to **approach zero operational considerations**, often referred to as "NoOps", for the Developer.

## Provider “implements” Operations

All the labor-intensive operational tasks are offloaded to the Serverless provider which include:

- **Maximizing Utilization**
    - Compute / Memory / Networking

- **Minimizing Compute Costs**
    - using a _[Pay-As-You-GO (PAYGO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAYGO)_ cost model

- **Guarantees all the "Ops"**
  - Scaling,
  - Low latency,
  - High Availability (HA),
  - Multi-region,
  - Monitoring,
  - Logging,
  - Security

_Your Serverlesss operational features savings varies by provider and their Service License Agreements (SLAs)._
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Across-the-board, IBM Cloud Functions and its SLA offers all these Operational services at the highest level of quality and service for every price plan.
{% endhint %}

As you will find by taking this course

{% hint style="success" %}
The IBM Cloud Functions (ICF) Serverless platform not only delivers on all these features, but also exceeds what most providers offer!
{% endhint %}

## Getting back to coding business logic

Thanks to Serverless, once the "Ops" is taken out of "DevOps", Developers can return their attention to writing truly amazing applications that focus on just the business logic. The end result is not only increased agility delivering software based on actual customer needs, but also serves to maximize Developer joy in doing their daily work.
