# What is serverless?

_"What is Serverless computing and what is it good for?"_

## Learning objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:

* What serverless computing is and its characteristics
* How serverless simplifies the operations landscape for developers
* The basic serverless programming model, using the semantics of IBM Cloud Functions (ICF), which includes:
  * The differences between Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) workloads and deployment models
* The top use cases for serverless, including:
  * Problems that serverless can best solve
  * Problems where traditional servers may work best
* Why ICF is a mature serverless platform that enables developer agility by supporting:
  * Polyglot programming languages
  * Logical functional compositions
  * Built-in event adapters to various services and data sources

Upon completion of this lesson, you should be able to:

* Summarize serverless computing in simple terms and be able to concisely describe why, as a technology, it is an essential part of low-cost, rapid cloud application development
* Identify and describe typical patterns of real-world problems that serverless computing is ideal in solving
* Describe advanced features ICF supports that make it ideal for serverless application development
