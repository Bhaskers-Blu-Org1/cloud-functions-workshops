# What is Serverless?

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson you will learn about:

* What Serverless computing is
  * Differentiating Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) from other Cloud solutions
* How it is simplifying the "Ops" landscape for Developers
  * Understand the basic Serverless programming model using the semantics of IBM Cloud Functions (ICF)
* What are the top use cases for Serverless
  * What are the types of problems Serverless is the right choice to solve
* How IBM Cloud Functions implements Serverless at a high-level
  * How ICF is a polyglot by supporting many programming languages
  * and allows Compositions of functions to create Serverless applications

Upon completion you should be able to:

* Summarize Serverless computing in simple terms and be able to concisely describe  why, as a technology, it is an essential part of low-cost, rapid Cloud application development.
* Identify and describe typical patterns of real-world problems that Serverless computing is ideal in solving.
