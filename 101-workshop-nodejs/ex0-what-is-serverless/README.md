# What is Serverless?

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson you will learn about:

* What Serverless computing is
  * its characteristics
* How it is simplifying the "Ops" landscape for Developers
  * Understand the basic Serverless programming model using the semantics of IBM Cloud Functions (ICF)
* Difference types of Serverless deployment models
  * including Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) _with their pros and cons_
* The top use cases for Serverless
  * The types of problems Serverless is the right choice to solve
  * and where traditional servers may still be best
* How IBM Cloud Functions implements Serverless at a high-level
  * How ICF is a polyglot by supporting many programming languages
  * and allows Compositions of functions to create Serverless applications

Upon completion you should be able to:

* Summarize Serverless computing in simple terms and be able to concisely describe  why, as a technology, it is an essential part of low-cost, rapid Cloud application development.
* Identify and describe typical patterns of real-world problems that Serverless computing is ideal in solving.
