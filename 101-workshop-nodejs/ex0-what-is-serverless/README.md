# What is Serverless?

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson you will learn about:

* What Serverless computing is and its characteristics
* How Serverless simplifies the Operations landscape for Developers
* The basic Serverless programming model using the semantics of IBM Cloud Functions (ICF)
  * The difference between _Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)_ and _Container-as-a-Service (CaaS)_ workloads and deployment models
* The top use cases for Serverless
  * The types of problems Serverless is the right choice to solve
  * and where traditional servers may still be best
* Why IBM Cloud Functions is a mature Serverless platform that supports Developer agility by supporting:
  * _Polyglot_ programming languages
  * Logical functional _Compositions_
  * Built-in _Event adapters_ to various services and data sources

Upon completion you should be able to:

* Summarize Serverless computing in simple terms and be able to concisely describe  why, as a technology, it is an essential part of low-cost, rapid Cloud application development.
* Identify and describe typical patterns of real-world problems that Serverless computing is ideal in solving.
* Describe advanced features IBM Cloud Functions supports that make it a great choice for Serverless application development.
