# Writing Serverless Apps with IBM Cloud Functions

Mature Serverless platforms, such as IBM Cloud Functions, provide features that allow you to build cloud-native applications by composing your Serverless functions into more complex data transformations and workflows.

This section will describe some ICF-specific features that differentiate it from other Serverless platforms and enable developers in writing truly amazing Serverless applications.

## What's a Polyglot?

IBM Cloud Functions is a polyglot Serverless platform meaning it understands and supports multiple programming languages for authoring functions.

This allows developers to choose the language that works best for them, which can:

- Reduce the need to learn new languages
- Increase code reuse _simplifying migration_
  - Especially important when integrating with services and data sources that provide libraries in specific languages.
- Leverage language-specific knowledge to code more efficient functions

### ICF Supported languages

The ICF team attempts to provide all the most popular Serverless languages and versions; their current list of supported language "runtimes" can always be found here:
[Runtimes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-runtimes)

This currently includes the lastest LTS releases for:
- NodeJS
- Python
- Swift
- PHP

if your language is not supported, you can always create your own language runtime using a Docker skeleton or build from compatible runtimes for other languages from the Apache OpenWhisk project:

- [Apache OpenWhisk -> Downloads -> Action Runtimes](https://openwhisk.apache.org/downloads.html#component-releases)

## Using Namespaces and Packages

ICF provides a naming convention that allows developers to organize their functions and apply access control.

### Namespaces

Actions, Triggers, and Rules always belong in a namespace. If a namespace is not explicitly provided, they are created in a default namespace.

### Packages

Packages are logical, named groupings that can contain Actions and Feeds. A package cannot contain another package, so package nesting is not allowed.

Actions and Feeds do not need to belong to a package, but then developers would have to worry about name collisions.

## Using Sequences and Compositions
