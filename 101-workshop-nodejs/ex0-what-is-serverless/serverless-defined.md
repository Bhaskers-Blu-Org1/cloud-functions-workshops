# What is serverless?

It's most likely that the term _serverless_ was coined to attract the attention of developers wishing to reduce the server costs of running their applications. Although the name implies that code can be run without the need for classic servers, that simply is not true!

There are a number of definitions for serverless concepts, but for the purpose of this course, serverless is defined as follows:

{% hint style="definition" %}
**serv&middot;er&middot;less**
/Ëˆs&#601;rv&#601;rl&#601;s/
_adjective_ (of computing)
1. _Event-driven application programming using stand-alone functions with no deployment or operational considerations_
{% endhint %}

To be clear, serverless is a misnomer. How? Because servers exist but are not a concern for developers!
