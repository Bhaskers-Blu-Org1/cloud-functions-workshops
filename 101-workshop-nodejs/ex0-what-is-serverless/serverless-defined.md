# What is Serverless?

## The marketing hype

Likely, thanks to some _marketing person_, the term _"Serverless"_ was coined to attract the attention of people wishing reduce the server costs of running their applications.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The name implies that code can be run without the need for classic servers _**which is absolutely not true**_!
{% endhint %}

## The ideal of Serverless

You can likely find any number of definitions for the concept of Serverless, but _"in-a-nutshell"_ and for the purpose of this course, you can think of it as:

{% hint style="definition" %}
**serv&middot;er&middot;less**
/ˈs&#601;rv&#601;rl&#601;s/
_adjective_ (of computing)
1. _Event-driven application programming using stand-alone functions with no deployment or operational considerations_
{% endhint %}

### Serverless "is a" misnomer

To be clear...

{% hint style="success" %}
_**<u>Servers exist</u>**, but are <u>not</u> the Developer’s concern._
{% endhint %}
