# Welcome to the IBM Cloud Functions Introductory Workshop

Hello future Serverless developers! ðŸ‘‹

_Welcome to the Introductory Workshop that is designed to teach you how to develop **serverless applications**, composed of loosely coupled microservice-like functions, using the [IBM Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions) service which is based upon the [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/) open-source serverless platform._

We will start by getting discussing what Serverless is, what it is good for and how it works running on IBM Cloud Functions. Then we will quickly get your development environment set up so we can dive into creating, deploying and invoking serverless functions using NodeJS. Of course you are free to use your favorite language, such as Python, Java, or Swift and we will show you how to replace the NodeJS functions with equivalent code.

Once you are comfortable creating serverless functions, the next step is to connect functions to events, like message queues, allowing microservices to fire automatically. Finally, we'll demonstrate how to expose serverless functions as public API endpoints, allowing to build serverless web applications.

Welcome to the future of cloud development, you'll never want to manage another server again ðŸ˜Ž.

**Are you, ready? Let's go!** ðŸš—
