# Welcome to the Serverless Computing Developer I course using IBM Cloud Functions

Hello, future serverless developers!

Welcome to the course that is designed to teach you the essentials of serverless computing and how to develop serverless applications, composed of loosely coupled microservice-like functions. In this course, you will be guided through several labs using [IBM Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions) (ICF), a Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform based on [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/) and the Node.js language that show you how to implement the essential concepts..

This course begins by providing an overview of serverless, its programming and deployment models and discusses its top use cases. Then we will put this knowledge into practice using the IBM Cloud Functions service on IBM Cloud. Once you follow some minimal steps to set up your development environment, we will dive into a series of "hands on" labs that will show you how easy it is to create, deploy, and invoke serverless functions using the Node.js language.

Once you are comfortable with managing serverless functions, we will then show you how to automate your functions to fire automatically by connecting them to event sources. Finally, you will learn how to expose your functions as public, web accessible HTTP endpoints and APIs, further simplifying the creation of serverless web applications.

Without further ado, welcome to the future of cloud development; you'll never want to manage another server again!

Are you ready? Let's go!

Although this course uses the Node.js language in its examples, you are free to use your favorite supported language, such as Python, PHP or Swift by simply supplying equivalent functional code.
