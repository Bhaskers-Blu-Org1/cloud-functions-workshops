# Welcome to the Serverless Computing using Cloud Functions - Developer I

Hello, future serverless developers!

Welcome to a course that is designed to teach you serverless computing essentials! Here you will learn how to develop serverless applications composed of loosely coupled microservice-like functions. Although many cloud providers offer different implementations of serverless using cloud functions, this course specifically guides you through several labs that demonstrate how to implement essential concepts using [IBM Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions) (ICF). ICF is a Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform based on [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/).

This course will also walk you through the following:

* An overview of serverless and its programming and deployment models
* Top use cases
* How to set up a development environment
* A series of hands-on labs that demonstrate how easy it is to create, deploy, and invoke serverless functions

Once you are comfortable with managing serverless functions, you will learn how to:

* Automate your functions to fire automatically by connecting them to event sources
* Expose your functions as public, web-accessible HTTP endpoints and APIs

Without further ado, welcome to the future of cloud development; you'll never want to manage another server again!

Are you ready? Let's go!

{% hint style="info" %}
Although this course uses the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ([JavaScript](https://nodejs.org/about/)) language in its examples, you are free to use your favorite supported language, such as Python, PHP or Swift by simply supplying your own equivalent functional code.
