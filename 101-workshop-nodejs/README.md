# Welcome to the Serverless Computing - Developer I - using Cloud Functions

Hello, future serverless developers!

Welcome to a course that is designed to teach you serverless computing essentials! Here you will learn how to develop serverless applications composed of loosely coupled microservice-like functions. In this course, you will be guided through several labs that demonstrate how to implement essential concepts using [IBM Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions) (ICF), a Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform based on [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/), and the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ([JavaScript](https://nodejs.org/about/)) language.

This course will also walk you through the following:

* An overview of serverless and its programming and deployment models
* Top use cases
* How to set up a development environment
* A series of hands-on labs that demonstrate how easy it is to create, deploy, and invoke serverless functions

Once you are comfortable with managing serverless functions, you will learn how to:

* Automate your functions to fire automatically by connecting them to event sources
* Expose your functions as public, web-accessible HTTP endpoints and APIs

Without further ado, welcome to the future of cloud development; you'll never want to manage another server again!

Are you ready? Let's go!

Although this course uses the Node.js language in its examples, you are free to use your favorite supported language, such as Python, PHP or Swift by simply supplying equivalent functional code.
