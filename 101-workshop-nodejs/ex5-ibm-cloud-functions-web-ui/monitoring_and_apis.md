# Monitoring and APIs

IBM Cloud Functions (ICF) Web UI comes with a [comprehensive visualization dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/dashboard) for monitoring serverless applications.

This dashboard shows activations within a region and namespace. Developers can see activation results, invocation times, and logging output through the dashboard. Activations displayed can be filtered by name or time window.

## APIs

HTTP endpoints for web actions can be created and managed through the ICF Web UI. Using this interface is often a lot more intuitive than using the CLI tool for managing more complex APIs.

Select "APIs" from the left-hand menu panel on the homepage.

### Details overview

The API details page shows properties for the chosen API, including an API monitoring page showing invocations.

Using the menu on the left-hand side, different properties for the API can be accessed and modified.

* **Definition** - API configuration properties, allows updating properties live.
* **Sharing** - Configure the exposing API with your internal users.
* **API Explorer** - API documentation for your endpoints.
